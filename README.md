# Holiday-Planner
As part of Database project, simulated a holiday planner web application involving a search functionality, using Google Places APIs(Places, Place Details, Place Photo). It takes user preferences like Interest (Adventure, Spiritual etc.) and Companion (Friends, Family etc.) and suggests destinations that have best ratings for those preferences.
